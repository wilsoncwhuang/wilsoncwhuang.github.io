<p>In our capstone project, we took Southeast Machinery Company as an example to discuss the optimization and control of make-to-order production process. In order to improve the manufacturing process of their plastic extruders, our team introduced Microsoft Project to their company and developed an internal project management system
by Project VBA. Eventually, we conducted a survey which based on SUS (system usability scale) for understanding user experience and therefore modification.</p>

<h3 id="about-southern-machinery">About Southern Machinery</h3>
<p>SOUTHEAST MACHINERY are fully capable of supplying a range of plastic extrusion machinery, would like blown film machine, waste recycling making machine and drinking straw making machine.</p>

<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Interviewed managers to find process defections</li>
  <li>Defined problems as reducing manufacturing time</li>
  <li>Created bill of materials, decomposed manufacturing process, and defined cost</li>
  <li>Utilized Microsoft Project for basic project management functions</li>
  <li>Constructed an internal system for extended and customized project management functions</li>
  <li>Tested the system and taught companyâ€™s faculty how to operate</li>
  <li>Conducted survey for user experience and made improvement</li>

<h3 id="microsoft-project">Microsoft Project</h3>
<p>After interviewing managers to know their business processes, we broke down their processes to a task list, and therefore generated a network diagram and Gantt chart.</p>

<h3 id="system-development">System Development</h3>
<p>Apart from using basic Microsoft Project functions, our team also developed an internal system via Project VBA to assist Southern Machinery in customizing its own functions. With the system we developed, the company can launch its initial schedule, then control, and record the progress and the cost. After the whole manufacturing process, the manager can use this system to visualize data and generate relevant reports. The following images are the system of each business process.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="user-testing">User Testing</h3>
<p>At the end of system development, we launched a survey with google form which based on SUS in order to understand their user experience.
<img src="/assets/images/Undergrad Capstone Project/User Experience.png" alt="user experience" title="user experience" />
From the responses we got, we could know:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Southern Machinery is willing to implement our system in the manufacturing process in the future.</li>
  <li>Southern Machinery has difficulty quickly understanding how to use this system. Our team, therefore, wrote a user manual for them.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="result-and-discussion">Result and Discussion</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In this stage, we just implement three phase plastic extruder manufacturing process in this system. We recommend Southern Machinery can also implement their other products.</li>
  <li>Our team only optimized the assembly process because of the limited data Southern Machinery could give. We suggested Southern Machinery can also optimize their supply chain.</li>
