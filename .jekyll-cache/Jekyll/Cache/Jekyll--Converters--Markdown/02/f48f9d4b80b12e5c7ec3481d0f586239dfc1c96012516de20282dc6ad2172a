<p>Loans are important to lenders and borrowers. It is important to identify the risky behaviors of clients and make educated decision. 
This paper is built on an end-to-end machine learning case study for predicting the defaulting risk associated with a borrower. 
The paper highlights on the exploratory data analysis of the datasets, feature engineering and machine learning modeling techniques and assess the results of these models.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>There has been a significant increase in the banking industry recently in which the unbanked population who are not privy to financial literacy are discriminated against when applying to loans. 
This means thereâ€™s an inequity in the field of loan granting that needs to be remedied. Our objective is to predict the likelihood of loan repayment to better distribute loans. 
We came across a dataset on Kaggle from HomeCredit whose mission is to broaden financial inclusion for unbanked populations.</p>

  <h4 id="background">1.1 Background</h4>
  <p>The dataset consisted of seven different sheets: current application, bureau balance, credit card balance, installments, cash balance and previous installments. 
The main objective is to identify the potential Defaulters based on the given data about the applicants. 
The probability of classification is essential because we want to be very sure when we classify someone as a Non-Defaulter, as the cost of making a mistake can be very high to the company. 
Our goal was to utilize important features from these sources to identify which would be key in the resultant machine learning model. Our methodology included cleansing the data, visualizing various elements to better understand it, feature selection, model fitting, and derive our final conclusions.</p>

  <p>Since the dataset was created for a datathon, the testing data did not include the labeled response. Therefore, we decided to create a 70/30 split on the training set in order to test the accuracy of the model.</p>

  <h4 id="data-processing">2.1 Data Processing</h4>
  <p>Data preparation is integral to deriving clear and accurate results from a machine learning model. There are specific properties we noted when taking a deep dive into the data. It was incredibly dense, spanning across ~450 columns in total and ~307,000 rows. 
There were inconsistencies in the data types within the columns as well meaning it was heterogeneous in nature. It was also time-varying and there were unbalances in some of the responses that required cleansing. 
The following flow was utilized to understand the scope of the data and determine which predictive model would be best.</p>
