<p>The Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) algorithm is used to efficiently keep track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
It has two main operations: <br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Union</strong>: merge two subsets.</li>
  <li><strong>Find</strong>: determine which particular subset the element belongs.</li>
</ul>
