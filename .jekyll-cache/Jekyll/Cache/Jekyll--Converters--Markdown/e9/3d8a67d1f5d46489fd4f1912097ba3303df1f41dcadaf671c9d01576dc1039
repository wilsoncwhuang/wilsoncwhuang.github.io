<h3 id="11-overview">1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>Revenue forecasting has always been crucial for businesses to prepare for upcoming demands and long-term
strategic planning. It provides insights in demand planning, storage space allocation, human resource planning, logistics
arrangements, and more. Therefore, business owners often deploy certain data analytics models to simulate outcomes that
can capture future trends for their operations. Models used to conduct such a simulation may vary based on its required
precision or capability for dynamically adjusting to irregularities, but all models are aiming for similar results. Some
common predicting models that utilize machine learning techniques for sales forecasting include linear regression, random
forest regressions, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM) model, ARIMA time series
forecasting, and more [1]. In this project, we will be using multivariate linear regression techniques to forecast sales trends
for targeted retail stores.</p>

<h3 id="12-subject-for-analysis---walmart-supercenters">1.2 Subject for Analysis - Walmart Supercenters</h3>
<p>For this project, we will be using regression models to forecast future sales of Walmart Supercenters within the
United States. Based on their business model [2], Walmart Supercenters provides a one-stop shopping experience by
combining grocery stores with fresh produce, bakery, deli and dairy products. They also include electronics, apparel, toys,
and home furnishing items to customers with various needs. Furthermore, most supercenters are open 24 hours with
additional services such as banks, hair, pharmacy, and more. The main source of customers for Walmart is from physical
retail stores, such as Walmart Superstores, and e-commerce sales. Based on figure 1, we can see that even though the total
number of Walmart stores has been slightly decaying, the number of supercenters is still increasing. This indicates the
significance of Walmart Supercenters in the United States Region. Therefore, an effective model to forecast future sales
for Walmart Supercenters would provide a critical advantage for senior level executives and managers to plan ahead.</p>

<h2 id="2-problem-statement">2. Problem Statement</h2>
<p>In this project, our goal is to predict the weekly sales of Walmart stores based on historical data with several
independent variables. Here we selected 10 independent variables that we assume may influence the weekly sales ‚Äì date,
temperature, fuel price, Consumer Price Index, unemployment rate, etc. We further elaborate on these independent and
dependent variables as below. One of the biggest challenges for building an effective regression model depends on the
quality of selected factors and understanding its correlations between each predictors. As we are curious about what
factors may affect the sales revenue of a retail store in the US, we plan to conduct a series of regression analysis with
residual analysis and other data validation techniques to find out the most relevant variables. By finalizing these findings,
we can better predict the weekly sales with these selected predictors.</p>

<h2 id="3-data-description">3. Data Description</h2>
<p>We used the open-source dataset <strong>‚ÄúWalmart Dataset‚Äù</strong> on Kaggle, the largest data science platform in the world.
We got the dataset as a CSV file directly from the URL address:
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset</a>. Our dataset covers the historical sales records and other
variables of 45 Walmart stores for the period from 2010/2/5 to 2012/11/1. The sample size of the Walmart Dataset is
6,435. As we split the column <strong><em>Date</em></strong> in the Walmart Dataset into 4 different columns (<strong><em>Year</em></strong>, <strong><em>Month</em></strong>, <strong><em>Day</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Weekday</em></strong>),
the number of independent variables will be 10 and the number of dependent variables is 1 in the dataset. In addition, we
split the sample dataset into a training set and a test set with an 8:2 ratio (train = 5,148, test = 1,287) to ensure that our
prediction is unbiased. Since our current model to obtain the response variable, weekly sales for a specific Walmart store
(<strong><em>Weekly_Sales</em></strong>), is a time-dependent study with a 1-week period between each data point, we can assume the data points
we use are time-dependent. The following table summarizes the description and categories of our 11 variables:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Walmart Sales Prediction/3-1.png" alt="3-1" title="3-1" /></p>

<p>For the qualitative variables, <strong><em>Holiday_Flag</em></strong> can be viewed as a dummy variable that indicates whether a specific
data point includes holidays within its period. This variable is related to our assumption that holidays may create a
temporary spike in demand, which leads to a higher weekly sales amount for the store. The other qualitative variable is
Store, which simply indicates the Walmart store number that is covered in our study. Since the study only includes a
certain amount of stores to analyze, the data directly assign each store with a numerical value between 1 to 45 (total
Walmart store within the study: 45).</p>
