I"–<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In our capstone project, we took Southeast Machinery Company as an example to discuss the optimization and control of make-to-order production process. In order to improve the manufacturing process of their plastic extruders, our team introduced Microsoft Project to their company and developed an internal project management system
by Project VBA. Eventually, we conducted a survey which based on SUS (system usability scale) for understanding user experience and therefore modification.</p>

<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Interviewed managers to find process defections</li>
  <li>Defined problems as reducing manufacturing time</li>
  <li>Created bill of materials, decomposed manufacturing process, and defined cost</li>
  <li>Utilized Microsoft Project for basic project management functions</li>
  <li>Constructed an internal system for extended and customized project management functions</li>
  <li>Tested the system and taught companyâ€™s faculty how to operate</li>
  <li>Conducted survey for user experience and made improvement</li>

      <li><strong>Gap 2</strong>: Build accurate planning for outsoucing items</li>
      <li><strong>Gap 3</strong>: Increase the number of confirmations when executing the project to prevent unexpected accidents and accelerate the communication with suppliers</li>
      <li><strong>Gap 5</strong>: Gain a deeper understanding of customer needs and let the product be closer to their needs</li>
